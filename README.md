# Computer Sciences Project - Texas Hold'em
This was my project for the course CS 4398 where me and my group made a Texas Hold'em game on python.

## Purpose of the system
Use available tools in python and various libraries such as pygame, as well as 
some of our own created poker AI, to create a fun simulation of a Texas Holdâ€™em 
poker game.
By doing so we walked through the process of software engineering as a group, 
made statecharts and class diagrams, made acceptance cases and unit tests for 
our program, and used GitHub to manage our files as we worked on the project. 

# How to run the program
To run this game you will need to pip install phevaluator, pygame, and pygame_widgets.
Then you can run this game by going to the path where you downloaded the program to and run the program through the command "py main.py" on your command prompt.
